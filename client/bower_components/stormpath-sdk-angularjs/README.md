# Stormpath AngularJS SDK [BETA]


[![Bower Version](https://img.shields.io/bower/v/stormpath-sdk-angularjs.svg?style=flat)](https://bower.io)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-angularjs.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-angularjs)

*A simple user authentication library for AngularJS.*


This library provides services and directives for [AngularJS] that will allow
you to solve these common user management tasks in your AngularJS application:

* Register new users
* Login users
* Verify new accounts via email tokens
* Secure password reset via email tokens
* Conditionally render parts of your UI, based on login state
* Control access to application routes

Under the hood, this library uses Oauth Access Tokens (JWTs) as the authentication
mechanism.  This library implements the best-practice approaches that we outline in
[Token Based Authentication for Single Page Apps (SPAs)](https://stormpath.com/blog/token-auth-spa/).

If you have feedback about this library, please get in touch and share your
thoughts! support@stormpath.com

[Stormpath](https://stormpath.com) is a User Management API that reduces
development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure.  Stormpath's
intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate,
manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Installation

If you are using Bower, simply install it:

```bash
bower install --save stormpath-sdk-angularjs
```

If you want to manually load the minified scripts, you can grab them from the `dist`
folder in this repo and include them manually:

```html
<script src="stormpath-sdk-angularjs.min.js"></script>
<script src="stormpath-sdk-angularjs.tpls.min.js"></script>
```

You can then require the Stormpath modules in your application:

```javascript

var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['stormpath','stormpath.templates']);

```

The templates are optional, see the documentation for more information.


## Documentation & Guide

If you are starting a new project, the
[Stormpath AngularJS Guide](http://docs.stormpath.com/angularjs/guide/index.html)
will be your best choice.  It will help you get started with a new project and an API
server for your application.

If you already have an Angular project, you will want to visit the
[Stormpath AngularJS SDK API Documenation](https://docs.stormpath.com/angularjs/sdk/).
That documentation will show you all the available directives and services that you
can use in your application.

## Example application

This repository contains a working example application in the `example/dashboard-app` folder.
This is the application that we build in the [Stormpath AngularJS Guide](http://docs.stormpath.com/angularjs/guide/index.html).
If you would like to skip the guide and start using the example application, do the following:

1) Install [Bower] and [Grunt] if you don't already have them

2) Clone this repo

3) In your terminal, change directories to the `example/dashboard-app` folder

4) Run `npm install && bower install`

5) Copy the file `example/dashboard-app/server/config/local.env.sample.js` to
`local.env.js` (in the same directory) and add your Stormpath variables for the
Stormpath Applicaiton that you will be using.

6) Run `grunt serve` to start the example application, which will be
available at http://localhost:9000
